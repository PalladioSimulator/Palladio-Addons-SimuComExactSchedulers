# Palladio-Addons-SimuComExactSchedulers
The abstract simulation engine provides generic simulation concepts
that are common to most discrete-event simulation libraries.
Concrete simulation libraries are used to implement the abstract
concepts. In this way, a simulator relying on the abstract simulation
engine is decoupled from a specific simulation engine. Moreover,
the simulation engine can be replaced without having to change
the simulation code.
